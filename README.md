# Instructor - The basics of structured output from LLMs
This repo goes over some very basic ways to get structured output from LLMs.
The example is a scenario where you want to classify a customer and add them to
an email list.


## Instructions
1. Initialize virtual environment ~ `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Initialize environment ~ `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies ~ `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create .env file ~ `touch .env`
    - Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=`
5. Run `fresh.py` ~ `python fresh.py`

Inspect the additional files, `examples.json` and `start.py`, if you want to get an idea of evaluating using assertions.
